# Zoonotic-diseases-in-Madagascar
As part of a broader One Health strategy, we are leading and participating in multiple collaborative research projects focused on the surveillance and characterization of zoonotic pathogens circulating at the human-wildlife interface across Madagascar. These projects aim to better understand pathogen ecology, host range, and transmission dynamics to inform both public health and conservation strategies.

## Detection of Rickettsia spp. in Small Mammals in Northeastern Madagascar
In collaboration with Dr. James Herrera from the Duke Lemur Center, this project investigates the presence and diversity of Rickettsia species in mites collected from small mammals captured in the northeastern forests of Madagascar. The work integrates field-based sampling, molecular diagnostics, and ecological analysis to identify mites and detect Rickettsia.

## Blood Parasite Surveillance in Small Mammals in Mantadia
In partnership with Dr. Steven Goodman of Association Vahatra, this project focuses on the detection and identification of blood parasites, including Trypanosoma and Plasmodium species in multiple species of small mammals from the National Park of Mantadia. The study combines field parasitology and PCR-based techniques to assess parasite diversity and distribution in different habitat types.

## Investigation of Leptospira in Lemurs and Rodents Across Multiple Sites
This multi-site project is carried out in Betampona, Kirindy, and Manombo Reserve, with contributions from Dr. Rachel Johnston (Zoo New England), Dr. Rebecca Lewis (University of Texas at Austin), and Dr. Fidisoa Rasambainarivo (East Carolina University). We examine Leptospira infection dynamics in wild lemur populations and sympatric rodents, integrating molecular diagnostics, serology, and ecological data to assess the effect of environment factors on the occurence of Leptospira.

## Investigation of Antimicrobial Resistance in Lemurs and Peridomestic Rodents in Manombo using Metagenomic Analysis
This project explores the burden and environmental drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in lemurs and rodents within and around Manombo Special Reserve. Through shotgun metagenomics and resistome analysis, we investigate how landscape changes and human influence shape AMR patterns. Collaborators include Dr. Rachel Johnston (Zoo New England), Elise Paietta (Duke University), and Laurent Raveloson (Health in Harmony Madagascar).

## Investigation of Leptospira Infection in Captive Lemurs and Sympatric Rodents in Malagasy Zoos
Led in collaboration with Dr. Julie Ter Beest from the Duke Lemur Center, this project focuses on zoonotic risks in captive settings, assessing Leptospira carriage in lemurs and commensal rodents across several zoos in Madagascar. The findings will help develop biosecurity and health monitoring protocols in ex situ conservation facilities.
